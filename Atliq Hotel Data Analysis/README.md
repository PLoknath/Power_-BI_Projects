## Key Insights

- With most guests staying for a day, there is an opportunity to create value-added services or experiences for short stays.
- High Daily saleable room nights (DSRN) and low RevPAR highlight the need to boost occupancy through targeted campaigns.
- Third-party platforms lead to the highest cancellations, suggesting a need for better           alignment with their policies and booking expectations.
- Elite rooms are the cornerstone of revenue, warranting priority in service enhancements.
- Atliq Exotica leads in terms of revenue, occupancy percentage, and RevPAR, while Atliq Seasons shows the lowest performance across these metrics.
