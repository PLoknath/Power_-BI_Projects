Loan Defaulter Analysis

Understanding loan defaults is crucial for financial institutions to minimize risk and make data-driven decisions. I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes state-wise, loan type-wise, loan term-wise, and grade-wise loan defaults, uncovering key trends and risk factors.

## Objective
- Analyze loan defaults across different states, loan terms, and applicant grades to identify high-risk segments.
- Evaluate the default rate for various loan types to determine which categories pose the highest risk.
- Compare state-wise default rates to identify regions with the highest loan delinquencies.
- Examine how loan tenure and applicant credit grade influence the likelihood of default.
- Provide insights to financial institutions for better loan approval strategies and risk mitigation measures based on the analysis.
